explain step by step how to convert matrix operation java code into c code

In C, we define the dimensions of the matrices using #define for better flexibility.
Functions (addMatrices, multiplyMatrices, printMatrix) are declared and defined for modularity and readability.
The loop indices and array dimensions are adjusted based on the predefined constants ROWS and COLS.
Used printf for formatted output.
main now explicitly calls functions with the matrices and their results.
